# Carousel Design for New Books #
*Content*
- index.html is a self-contained .html file that has html, CSS, and script.
- new-arrivals.xlsx minimally requires title, author, ISBNs (used to fetch Syndetics cover link), MMS ID (Alma specific ID used to generate permalink)

*Function*
- index.html automatically reads book records in new-arrivals.xlsx from the same directory, extracts cover image from URLs, titles, formats author names, and uses permalinks to open Primo records. 
- Smooth infinite auto-rotation & controls: auto starts at loading, rotates in a continuous loop, supported by Prev, Pause/Play, and Next navigation buttons.
- Hover behaviors: magnifies book covers by 1.15 times on mouse hover or keyboard focus, displaying the book title immediately on a card and author after a 1-second delay.
- Linking: Clicking any book cover opens Primo record in a new tab
- Responsive layout: dynamically adjusts the number of visible covers based on screen size (displaying 7 on desktops, 4 on tablets, and 2 to 3 on phones).

*Web Accessibility (WCAG) Features*
- Screen reader live announcements (aria-live): Features a hidden status region that announces state updates (e.g., pause/play status or active slide shifts) to screen reader users.
- Motion Sensitivity Compliance (prefers-reduced-motion): Automatically respects user operating system preferences by disabling auto-rotation and animations for users sensitive to motion.
- Keyboard Focus Indicators (:focus-visible): Ensures high-contrast focus outlines around all interactive links and buttons for keyboard-only navigation.
- Aria Labeling & Hidden Clones: Decorative looping duplicates are marked with aria-hidden="true" to prevent redundant screen reader announcements, and links include descriptive aria-label text combining titles and authors.
